This is a series of similar python scripts to update your various addons to the newest 1.17.1 Realm name Nordannar. This is pretty simple to do manually, but if you want to just click a few times you can use these scripts. If you want your addon to be added to this, let me know and I will help with that. The addons you see are just the addons that I use.

1) Download the addon script for the addon that you use
2) Use Python to run the script. You'll be prompted to select the addon's lua file in the following path:
   Turtle-Wow > WTF > Account > Account name > SavedVariables > Addon's.Lua file
3) I tested each of these scripts. It will replace the string of text "Turtle WoW" with Nordannar where appropiate so that your cached data will transfer with the new realm name.
