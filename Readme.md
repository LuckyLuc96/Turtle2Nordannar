I'm planning to write a command you can put into your command window or terminal that will use python to run these scripts. These scripts work to look where Turtle WoW is named in the data of various addons that may become lost when the server's name is updated. This will rename Turtle WoW to Nordanner where appropiate so that your saved data will stay the same. I have a template available for whoever wants to add to this repository. Right now these are all the addons that I personally use that will be affected. 

1) Install python3
2) paste this into your terminal:
